My name is Aubrey. With over a decade of service industry experience under my belt, I have set my sights on using my programming skills to help and support people + business.

My skills include the following languages:
- HTML5 - CSS3 - Sass - TailwindCSS - JavaScript (ES6) - React JS - Next JS - Headless CMS - Figma - Github - Git - Paired Programming

I am ready to apply these skills and to learn much more in my pursuit of becoming the best developer I can be to help support small business in my community.

Aside from programming, I have a distinct passion for everything music. Production, physical media, live shows, and singing are just a few things that I love to appreciate. I aspire to write and perform my own music sometime in the near future.
