Hi!

My name is Aubrey and I utilize my background in technology to construct functional, responsive, and accessible web design.
My professional work history with retail stores such as Best Buy and Apple has empowered me to fine-tune my problem-solving skills, allowing me to utilize hardware and software in order to improve people's lives in tangible ways.  

I am experienced in using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, and React languages.
